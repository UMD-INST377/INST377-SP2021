Lists

Let's make an unordered list.

Add an unordered list element
nest each item inside the unordered list in a list tag
List elements can be in any order

And now, one in order.

Add an ordered list element.
Add your top five music albums in order to the list.
Check it out, numbers by default.

Inline elements

Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Sometimes you want to do both.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Add a hard line under here.

This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
