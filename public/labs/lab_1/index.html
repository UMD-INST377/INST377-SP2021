<title>>Professor Alex's Internet Page</title>

First, the basics.

<h1>Alex Heading 1</h1>

Headings set your default page size

Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here. 

<h2>Lists</h2>

Let's make an unordered list.
<list>
<li>Add an unordered list element</li>
<li>nest each item inside the unordered list in a list tag</li>
<li>List elements can be in any order</li>
</list>
And now, one in order.
<ol>

<li>Add an ordered list element.</li>
<li>Add your top five music albums in order to the list.</li>
<li>Check it out, numbers by default.</li>
</ol>
Inline elements

<i>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.</i>

<b>Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.</b>

<i><b>Sometimes you want to do both.</b></i>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Add a hard line under here.<br />

This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
